# Linkedin-Analytics

We know how important LinkedIn has become in our life. Being an active member on LinkedIn with more than 600 connections, I wondered what my LinkedIn network looked like? Where do all of my connections work? What role did they work for?

With all these questions in mind and after searching I came across [this](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50191/downloading-your-account-data?lang=en) option on LinkdedIn which allows us to download .csv files containing information about our connections, messages, etc.

The LinkedIn-Analytics jupyter notebook uses these data files to analyze my connections over a period of time since I joined LinkedIn, which company they work for and what role are they in. The notebook also uses Sentiment Analysis to analyse the sentiments of my conversation held on LinkedIn. 
Further, from this analysis, I can make decisions regarding what kind of people I want to connect more with. It can also be helpful to analyse the negative sentiment messages which indeed can help me to focus my efforts more on the positive stories.

Do checkout my notebook! It has got some good visuals. Also, don't forget to analyse your network, you never know what's in there! :D
